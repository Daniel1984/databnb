1. graph label - Price per month
2. info block - show hi low based on daily rate rather than monthly (show todays price)
3. do not group by rating as optional thing, group by default and give no option to toggle
4. ignore previous months of availability info. Only take into count current month and all future months (doublecheck)

as soon as listing found - find availability and save! also keep updating progress for UI

- add average income per day among min and max


-- remove dependency on neighborhood
only use  it for when someone looking for properties from home page,
do not store neighborhood id in listing model or any other places
should only be used for fetching new properties in existing neighborhoods
